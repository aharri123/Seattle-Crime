# Seattle-Crime

## Business Goal ##
We'll be working with the great city of Seattle. Using two different classification algorithms (Random Forest and CatBoost), we'll determine which algorithm most accurately classifies not only types of new crimes, but also location of new crimes. Creating a successful model can lead to more efficient crime identification, which can have numerous positive effects on the city such as more efficient police action, allocation of various resources to more affected areas, and overall reduced crime.
